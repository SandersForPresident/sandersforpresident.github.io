[Field the Bern](https://fieldthebern.com/) is a canvassing mobile application to allow anyone to dive right into local canvassing. Users can log in and immediately browse the area to see what houses have been visited and which haven't. After knocking on a door and speaking with a resident, canvassers can record their interaction and gain points. Track your progress and compete with friends. Helping Bernie win is even more fun with this app!
