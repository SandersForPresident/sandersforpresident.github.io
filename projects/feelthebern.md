Think of [FeelTheBern.org](http://feelthebern.org) as the Wikipedia of Bernie Sanders, only better. Itâ€™s a search-friendly, sharing-optimized, rich-media website that clearly lays out in a sourced, fact-based manner exactly what Bernie has done, said, and proposed on every issue Americans care about. Created by 125+ unpaid volunteers in 32 days, its guiding principle is that information about the issues empowers voters (and the campaign).
