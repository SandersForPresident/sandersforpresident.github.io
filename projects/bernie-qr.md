The Bernie QR app is used to collect mailing list signups by volunteers at campaign events and also by hosts of Bernie events - organizing meetings, debate watch parties, etc. Guests visit [http://bernie.to/qr](http://bernie.to/qr) on their smartphone, fill out the form, and are given a QR code; volunteers/hosts then use the Bernie QR app to scan the code and process the signup.

The Bernie QR app is available on the [iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bernie-qr/id1047331796?ls=1&mt=8) and the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.berniesanders.signup_qr_scanner).
