Coders For Sanders is a loose collective of developers, designers, and creatives working to elect Bernie Sanders for President.

We originally began organizing on Reddit at [/r/codersforsanders](https://www.reddit.com/r/codersforsanders). We also make extensive use of Slack - you can join our team by filling out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pmxGTX17qPkZV49iuLh3rN-Mj_Z6w6M_XtUJMZCMIP4/viewform).

We are cross-platform and cross-interest - a cross-section of the technology community using the biggest and best tools and technologies to create web applications, mobile applications, and digital content. We are volunteers, united in our belief that America needs the progressive ideals espoused by Bernie Sanders to restore justice, equality, and prosperity to our country.
