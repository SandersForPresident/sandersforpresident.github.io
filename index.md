Coders For Sanders is a loose collective of developers, designers, and creatives working to elect Bernie Sanders for President.

We originally began organizing on Reddit at [/r/codersforsanders](https://www.reddit.com/r/codersforsanders). We presently do nearly all of our organizing on Slack - you can join our Slack team [here](https://cfs-slack.forsanders.com/).

We are cross-platform and cross-interest - a cross-section of the technology community using the biggest and best tools and technologies to create web applications, mobile applications, and digital content. We are volunteers, united in our belief that America needs the progressive ideals espoused by Bernie Sanders to restore justice, equality, and prosperity to our country.
